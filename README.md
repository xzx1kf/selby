TODO
====
* Scrape off all the information from the race card.
* Apply a more object oriented approach: 
    * Horse object, with applicable data attached
    * Race object, with applicable race information
    * Course object
* The parser could stay as is for now, but introduce the objects as a layer on
top
* Transform to use a database.
